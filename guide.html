    <p><b>Romania</b> is the largest country in Southeastern Europe and the twelfth-largest in Europe. It borders Bulgaria to the south, Ukraine to the north, Hungary to the west, Serbia to the southwest, Moldova to the east and the Black Sea to the southeast.

        The terrain is distributed roughly equally between mountains, hills, and plains. The Carpathian Mountains dominate the centre of Romania. It has a predominantly temperate-continental climate. This can favor a good stay during the vacancies given the multitude of seasonal choice
        
        Romania it is a European country full of charm and history. Just think of the woods of Transylvania, the ancient medieval towns, Monasteries and Castles including the Bran Castle built on the rock and associated with the myth of the legend of Dracula.
        Romania is also very popular for motorhome tourism that allows you to appreciate all its beauty up close.
        
        Romania offers a lot as a tourist country, sea, mountains, cities, forests, plains, the seasons allow you to fully enjoy a day at the beach, a day in the mountains skiing,hiking, etc.
        The best time to go hiking is from early May to mid-October. It also depends where you're going because in the high mountains (Fagaras, Piatra Craiului, Bucegi) there can still be snow until June and weather can be unpredictable - and unpleasant - at altitudes of over 1,800m. etc.
        The tourist trips to the cities are completely favorable and not very expensive, the food offers a vast and rich variety.
